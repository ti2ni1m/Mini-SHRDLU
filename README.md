# Mini-SHRDLU

A classic reconstruction of the Mini-SHRDLU board game. It incorporates search algorithms 
such as BFS, Best-first search, A* algorithm and Monte Carlo.

The project was created to display the efficiency and accuracy of certain search algorithms.
By comparing the previously mentioned algorithms, it was found that A* was the most accurate
and fastest to find the goal state. This project was a good introduction into data structures
and algorithm and can be further improved by applying more efficient data structures.

In the future I hope to alter algorithms to incorporate a map data structures, as this will
reduce complexity of the program.

To run the file you can use a chosen IDE and compile via the IDE, additionally if the computer
has a c++ compiler installed, then running these commands in the correct directory:

1. [compiler] main.cpp - o Driver
2. ./main

Will compile and run the program.
